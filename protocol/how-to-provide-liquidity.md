# ðŸ’° How to Provide Liquidity

In order to provide Liquidity, you first have to purchase either CATCOIN or CATSHARE, depending on which one you want to provide liquidity for.\
\
Buy CATCOIN here: [https://spooky.fi/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8CcD162E5997363Dc2101371B3B09f316D012306\&inputCurrency=0x04068da6c83afcfa0e13ba15a6696662335d5b75](https://spooky.fi/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8CcD162E5997363Dc2101371B3B09f316D012306\&inputCurrency=0x04068da6c83afcfa0e13ba15a6696662335d5b75)\
\
Buy CATSHARE here: [https://spooky.fi/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6E88D9A9D326bAC2AdE987b9Cd49c571Ec8a8A9e\&inputCurrency=0x04068da6c83afcfa0e13ba15a6696662335d5b75](https://spooky.fi/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6E88D9A9D326bAC2AdE987b9Cd49c571Ec8a8A9e\&inputCurrency=0x04068da6c83afcfa0e13ba15a6696662335d5b75)\
\
When you have bought CATCOIN and/or CATSHARE head over to the Liquidity tab in the left side on the menu. Next you have to choose Ingredient A and B.\
\
Ingredient A must either be CATCOIN or CATSHARE and ingredient B must be USDC. Note that ingredients A & B must be equal in value (SpookySwap will automatically calculate this for you) When you have selected both ingredients, click on supply and accept the transaction.\
\
Now that you have made a LP token you need stake it in one of the 8bitcats farm: - [https://www.8bitcats.com/farms](https://www.8bitcats.com/farms) Choose either CATCOINS-USDC LP or CATSHARE-USDC LP, depending which pool you provided liquidity for. You first need to approve the contract and thereafter you can stake your LP token by pressing the '+' button. Your LP token is now staked and you can enjoy reward returns in CATSHARE (the amount depends on the APR shown in the pool you are staked in).\
\
Now you need to compound your fees, meaning claim your CATSHARE rewards and stake it in the Boardroom: - [https://www.8bitcats.com/boardroom](https://www.8bitcats.com/boardroom) The Boardroom only prints new CATCOINS if TWAP is over 1.01. TWAP is listed on the Boardroom page.\
\
If TWAP is under 1.01, it will not print CATCOINS, therefore do not stake your CATSHARE here. Instead swap your CATSHARES for CATCOINS, to help CATCOIN reach Peg to 1 USDC. If you don't wanna swap all of your CATSHARES for CATCOINS, you can provide liquidity with the remaining CATSHARES by supplying it with USDC and make a LP token and stake in in the farm.\
\
If you don't have any USDC, you can sell 50% of your CATSHARE for USDC and provide LP that way.

Below is a rule of thumb on how to keep a protocol healthy:

* 40% CATSHARE rewards go to CATCOINS-USDC LP
* 30% CATSHARE rewards go to CATSHARE-USDC LP
* 20% CATSHARE rewards go to Boardroom only if TWAP is over 1.01. Otherwise rewards should go to CATCOINS-USDC LP in order to help CATCOIN reach Peg.
* 10% CATSHARE rewards go to wallet as profit or reinvest back into the protocol to become a larger holder and earn more on a daily basis.

Here is another method to keep the protocol healthy:\
Step 1: Provide CATCOINS-USDC liquidity in farm\
Step 2: Claim CATSHARE rewards from CATCOINS-USDC LP pool\
Step 3: Stake claimed CATSHARE rewards into the Boardroom if TWAP is over 1.01.\
Step 4: Claim the CATCOINS rewards from the Boardroom\
Step 5: Supply new CATCOINS-USDC LP with claimed CATCOIN\
Step 6: Stake new Catcoin-USDC LP into farm\
Step 7: Rinse repeat. If TWAP is under 1.01, you should buy CATCOINS to help it reach Peg and maintain a TWAP over 1.01.

So you might ask: Why do this instead of taking profits and leave?

Because if you keep taking your CATCOINS that are rewarded to you from the Boardroom and stake them in CATCOINS-USDC LP, you become a larger holder and will earn more on a daily basis than people that sell their CATCOINS for short gains.
