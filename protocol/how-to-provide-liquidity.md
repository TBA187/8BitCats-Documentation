# ðŸ’° How to Provide Liquidity

When you have bought CATCOIN and/or CATSHARE, head over to the Liquidity tab in SpookySwap located in the left side on the menu. Here you have to choose Ingredient A and Ingredient B.\
Ingredient A must either be CATCOIN or CATSHARE and ingredient B must be USDC. Note that ingredients A & B must be equal in value (SpookySwap will automatically calculate this for you) When you have selected both ingredients click on supply and accept the transaction. You should now have a LP Token (Liquidity Pool) in your wallet.\

## Yield farming through staking

In order to earn daily rewards through yield farming, you need to stake your LP Token in 8bitcats website here:
\ [https://www.8bitcats.com/farms](https://www.8bitcats.com/farms) 
\
Choose either CATCOINS-USDC LP or CATSHARE-USDC LP, depending which pool you provided liquidity for.\
In order to stake, you first need to approve the contract by pressing the 'Approve' button on the page. Thereafter you can stake your LP Token by pressing the '+' button on the page. Your LP token is now staked and you can enjoy daily reward returns in CATSHARE (the amount depends on the APR shown in the pool you are staked in).\
\
As you are earning staking rewards, you should consider compounding your fees, meaning claim your CATSHARE rewards and stake it in the Boardroom:\
[https://www.8bitcats.com/boardroom](https://www.8bitcats.com/boardroom)\
The Boardroom only prints new CATCOINS if TWAP is over 1.01. TWAP is listed in the Boardroom page.\
If TWAP is under 1.01, it will not print CATCOINS, therefore do not stake your CATSHARE here. Instead swap your CATSHARES for CATCOINS, to help CATCOIN reach Peg to 1 USDC. If you don't want to swap all of your CATSHARES for CATCOINS, you can provide liquidity with the remaining CATSHARES by supplying it with USDC and make a new LP Token and stake it in the farm./
If you don't have any USDC, you can sell 50% of your CATSHARE for USDC and provide LP that way.\
\
Here is a method to keep the protocol healthy: (Only if TWAP is over 1.01, meaning CATCOIN is over PEG)
* Step 1: Provide CATCOINS-USDC liquidity in farm
* Step 2: Claim CATSHARE rewards from CATCOINS-USDC LP pool
* Step 3: Stake claimed CATSHARE rewards into the Boardroom
* Step 4: Claim the CATCOINS rewards from the Boardroom
* Step 5: Supply new CATCOINS-USDC LP with claimed CATCOIN
* Step 6: Stake new Catcoin-USDC LP into farm
* Step 7: Rinse repeat. 
\
If TWAP is under 1.01, you should buy CATCOINS to help it reach Peg and maintain a TWAP over 1.01\
